# A very simple program

This problem set will introduce you to the programming environment IDLE and to
programming in Python, as well as to our general problem set structure. In this
problem set, you will install IDLE, write a simple Python program, and hand it
in. Be sure to read this problem set thoroughly.

You may discuss the problems with other students. *However, each student should
write up and hand in his or her assignment separately. You will get in trouble
if your code looks too much like someone else's work.* Be sure to indicate with
whom you have worked.

IDLE is the [integrated development
environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
we're using to edit and run Python programs. When you start a new program,
please save it onto your `N:` drive and save it each time you run the program.
The filenames that you should use are mentioned in the assignments.

## Preparation

To be able to program a solution to this problem set, you need to read up on the follow documentation:

* [Introduction](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap01.html) from *How to think like a Computer Scientist*
* [Variables and statements](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/chap02.html) from *How to think like a Computer Scientist*
* [Variables and strings](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Variables_and_Strings) from *Python Programming*
* [Input and output](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Input_and_output) from *Python Programming*

The PDFs of these books are linked on the main page.

## Entering and printing your name

Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out results (using
the `print` operation), the ability to read input from a user at the console
(for example using the `raw_input` operation), and the ability to store values
in a variable, so that the program can access that value as needed.

Write a program that does the following in order:

1. Ask the user to enter his/her last name.
2. Ask the user to enter his/her first name.
3. Print out the user's first and last names in that order.

An example of an interaction with your program is shown below:

    Enter your last name:
    **Grimson
    Enter your first name:
    **eric
    eric
    Grimson

## Hints

To see how to use the `print` command, you may find it convenient to look at the input and output section of the [Python Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Input_and_output). This will show you how to use `print` statements to print out values of strings.

To see how to read input from a user's console into the Python environment, you may find it convenient to look at the same section (see for example the `raw_input` function).

Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in a *variable* (thus, give it a name to which you can refer when you want that value). You may find it convenient to look at the variables and strings section of the [Python Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Variables_and_Strings).
